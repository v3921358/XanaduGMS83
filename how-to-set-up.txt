How to set up and use C++ Xanadu GMS source

Hello,

I am creating this thread to give detailed information to possible users, contributors and interested people on how to set up and use my source Xanadu, which is written in C++ and currently supporting v0.62 GMS on the main branch and v0.83 GMS on the xanadu_083 branch (v0.83 is still being worked on).

Now it will take some time to make this thread good, I just start with some information that might be enough for people and I will add more details and enhance it soon.

Help requests are alright in this thread (assuming the section rules don't forbid that).

required operating system

one of the following:

windows 7 64 bit (untested)
windows 8 64 bit (untested)
windows 8.1 64 bit (used and tested by the developer)
windows 10 64 bit (untested)

required programs, these need to be installed/put in place:

* mysql server, version 5.7.x, 64 bit
* mysql workbench, version 6.3.x, 64 bit
* visual studio 2015 (community edition or other), update 3 for it is recommended
* the target maplestory version (atleast the .wz files are needed;
the default game path in the source is: "C:\\Nexon\\MapleStory v0.62" (it's changeable in game_constants.hpp))

how to set up the source:

* execute the sql files using mysql workbench

* setup and compile the poco library (or have the already compiled .lib files ready)
1. download poco C++ libraries Complete Edition 1.7.6
2. extract it to C:\\
3. in the Foundation folder, open Foundation_x64_vs140.sln, set the mode to debug_static_md and compile, then set the mode to release_static_md and compile
4. in the Data folder, open Data_x64_vs140.sln, set the mode to debug_static_md and compile, then set the mode to release_static_md and compile
5. in the Data\\MySQL folder, open MySQL_x64_vs140.sln, set the mode to debug_static_md and compile, then set the mode to release_static_md and compile
important Note: when getting compilation errors related to mysql.h file, abort compilation and replace <mysql.h> where the error is with C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\include and compile again/re-compile it

* the angelscript library needs to be setup by downloading it, extracting it and compiling it.

get it from: http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/downloads.html

path should be: C:\angelscript_2.31.2\ (containg sdk and deeper folders)
go to: C:\angelscript_2.31.2\sdk\angelscript\projects\msvc2015
open angelscript.sln
set the option to x64 on the almost top bar in visual studio.
set to multithreaded debug dll (debug) and mutlithreaded dll (release) in the code generation options in the project options
then compile for debug and release
done, my source can now be compiled and used.

* open xanadu.sln and compile the source (for testing and developing: in Debug mode, for other purposes: in Release mode)
in visual studio do the following:
for testing and developing: use the start debugging button or press F5 to start and debug the server
for other purposes: use the start without debugging button or press Strg+F5 to start the server
Note: Windows firewall or other firewalls either need to be deactivated or when prompted at the server start, allow the server to start to listen to connections and such

Greetings

Buya
